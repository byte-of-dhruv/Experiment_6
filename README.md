# Experiment_6

Aim

The aim of this experiment is to study, understand, and implement dictionary data structures in Python. This experiment focuses on performing various operations on dictionaries such as creation, accessing values, updating elements, overwriting existing data, checking length and type, and solving basic real-world problems using dictionaries. Through this experiment, we learn how dictionaries store data in key–value pairs and how they are used to efficiently manage and retrieve data in Python programs.

Theory

A dictionary in Python is a built-in data type used to store data in the form of key–value pairs. Each key in a dictionary is unique, and it is used to access its corresponding value.

Dictionaries are written using curly braces {}, with keys and values separated by a colon :.

Dictionaries are mutable, which means their contents can be changed after creation. They are unordered, meaning the items do not have a fixed position like lists or tuples.

Characteristics of Python Dictionaries:

Stores data as key–value pairs

Keys must be unique

Values can be of any data type

Mutable in nature

Fast access using keys

Basic Dictionary Operations:

Creation: Creating a dictionary using {}.

Accessing Values: Using keys to retrieve values.

Updating Values: Modifying values using keys.

Adding New Items: Assigning new key–value pairs.

Deleting Items: Removing data using del.

Length Calculation: Using len() to count items.

Type Checking: Using type() function.

Applications of Dictionary:

Storing student records

Managing product prices

User authentication systems

Marks and grading systems

Configuration settings

Database-like storage in programs

Dictionaries are widely used in Python because they provide fast lookup, better readability, and efficient data management. They play an important role in real-world applications such as login systems, inventory management, and data analysis.

Conclusion

In this experiment, we successfully studied and implemented various dictionary operations in Python. We learned how to create dictionaries, retrieve and modify values, overwrite existing data, calculate the length, and determine the data type of a dictionary. We also solved practical problems using dictionaries, which helped us understand their real-world applications.

This experiment demonstrates that dictionaries are a powerful and flexible data structure in Python. They allow efficient storage and retrieval of data using keys, making programs more organized and readable. Thus, dictionaries are an essential concept for effective Python programming.
